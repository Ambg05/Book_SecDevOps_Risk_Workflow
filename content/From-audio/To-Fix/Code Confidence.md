**Code Confidence**

Most teams don't have confidence in their code or the code that they use, the third parties, the SUP of dependencies that they have on the application. And that is a problem because the less confidence you have in your code, the less likely you are to want to make changes to that code. The more you are afraid to touch it, the slow your changes are, the slow your re-factoring is and the slow securing it actually it will be.

So, I think we need to find ways to measure the confidence of code, in a way code confidence index for example. Which would allow us to start to see which teams are doing it correctly, which teams aren't doing it correctly and what actually are the factors that allow us to measure that metric. 

And ultimately, the logic should be that the teams with a high confidence are the teams who are making better software, who are re-factoring better, who ship faster, in a way are better developer teams.
