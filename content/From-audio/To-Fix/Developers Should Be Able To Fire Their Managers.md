**Developers Should Be Able To Fire Their Managers**

A lot of the problems with dev teams is that the power structure is inverted. There is this idea that sometimes the management or the person who is kind of managing the developers is actually the one that should be ultimately in power and ultimately in charge and responsible and accountable.

That is actually very wrong because sometimes the best person and the person who should be in power to make the key technological and hard decisions is actually the developer, is actually that person that is hands on writing the code, reading all the lines of code to make sure that everything is there.

And so what you have is you have sometimes this perverse situation where the managers are not coding anymore, they had been promoted maybe in the past for all sorts of reasons, maybe they were great programmers in the past but they aren't programmers anymore and they don't really understand how things work anymore.

So you have this problem where those guys are in charge in a way they shouldn't be. Their job is to make the developers more productive, so their job is to do customer liaison, manage the team, manage the results of the team, make sure everything is smooth, organize things, do reviews, do all sorts of things or facilitate reviews, deal with the business, handle business requirements, handle expectations, go to meetings, that is the job of the manager that is the job of that entity who is actually in a way acting as the voice of the developer team.

In fact that person should be defending the dev team, should basically act like an agent for that team. So what it means it means that ultimately the balance of power, the decisions and ultimately who can control who that person is, i.e. who can sack that person should be the dev or a group of devs.  Because they are the ones who actually ultimately are responsible for delivering something.

So, they are the ones that should be empowering those decisions including somehow hard core decisions like pay, perks, budgets you need to start treating the developer teams as grownups as they are.

And basically it is sometimes very inefficient when you have the situation because sometimes also it promotes inefficiencies it makes the managers become very work hard on, they don't want to share stuff, they also want to basically take ownership of maybe things the developers did or ideas others did because they don't have those ideas in their place. So that gets very political very fast and kind of not productive.

So ultimately my view is that the balance of power should be with the devs because they ultimately are the ones that are accountable for what is being created on the company.
