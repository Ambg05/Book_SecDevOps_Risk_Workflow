**Why Secdevops**

I like secdevops because it reinforces the idea that is an extension to dev ops. And for me, it points to the objective that eventually we want the sec part to disappear and just becomes dev ops.

Because ultimately, what we want is an environment where developers and operations 99% of the time don't care about security i.e. they are programming in an environment where they are not able to create security vulnerabilities or is very hard to create them or very easy to detect when they create security issues.

So what is very key here to understand is that this doesn't mean that you don't need security teams, this doesn't mean that you don't need app sec experts and you don't need a huge amount of work behind the scenes and a huge amount of technology in order to create those environments.

So the idea here is that you don't make security invisible by getting rid of it, you are making security invisible by automating the security checks, by increasing visibility into what is going on.

Because an interesting concept is the fact that at the moment, when we look at security activities, a lot of the times what we see is security doing things and actions that are really the responsibility of development, or testing, or infrastructure or documentation or even management.

Anybody who is doing app sec for a while always find themselves in positions where they ask really hard questions. They basically poke the system in really hard ways where ultimately that should be already understood.

So when we create tools to attack an application, a lot of times we are just creating tools to visualize what is going on. I have had many experiences where I spend more time creating technology to for example understand the attack surface and once I do that then you find a huge amount of vulnerabilities simply because there is a huge amount of part of the application that weren't tested, they just weren't fully understood and the system owners and the multiple players didn't really understand how the application behaved in particular ways.

So I think secdevops is an interesting evolution, it is an interesting point in history where what we are trying to do is in a way merge all these great activities that have been going on in security with also the great activities that have been going on with quick development and operations and creating environment where you can basically create and deploy secure applications.

And this goes very close to the ideas I pushed in measuring, using application security to measure quality because ultimately what we are talking about is the quality of the application, we are also talking about the unintended consequences of software which is basically what we are trying to eliminate here.

One word about devsecops, devsecops initially sounds better because you could put development first. But I really agree with a view where devsecops it is more about applying development to security operations. And I think that yes we need that, in fact that needs to be secure, it is still a massive area where there is great gaps at the moment but the key is dev ops, the key is security dev ops which is basically what sec ops should be all about.

And this all then ties up together with the risk work flows which make things much more connected and accountable.
