**Everything You Do Is Hyper-linked**

It is key as a professional whether you are a developer or a security person that everything you do is actually able to be link able i.e. in a location where somebody can just click on a link and hit it.

And this basically means that what you are creating now is scale able, now it can be shared, now it can be found easily, it can be basically part of a work flow that is simply not possible when you don't hyper-link stuff.

So the way I look at it is an email is a black box, an email is just this dump of stuff which it is a massive waste of opportunity because once it goes in there you struggle to find. Yes you could still create a massive mess when you start to link things and you start to connect things and you start to generate all sorts of data but at least you are playing a better game. At least you are in a path where it would be much easier in a medium term for somebody to come in, click it up, make sure it is improved so it is a much better model.

So the key is what I tell over and over again the guys I work with is always create links, always create materials that are link able. And in a way so that is what I said make sure whatever you do is hyper link able. 

And the other thing that is allowed is for others to help you. So what happens is if you share something with a link, sometimes in the future somebody can be proactive and go and find it, do something about it, connect to it and that is how you scale.

The thing to remember when you are playing this game is that you are playing a long game, it is connected to the idea that you are talking to your future self. So it is not about immediate response, it is not about what happens today, it is about changing the pattern, staging the flows.

So once you send enough links out to people, then they start to know where to find it, they start to know, "Oh let me look there first for that piece of information".

So, it goes down to the idea that when every time I write something that has more than a couple of paragraphs I try to put into a link so that so in a way my future self or somebody else in the future might be able to find it and in a way propagate that information without your active involvement.

One more final point is that when you put it publicly, and when you put it in a hyper link able position ideally in a public hyper linked position because that also makes a massive difference if it is actually available to a wider audience either completely to the internet or just to internal company you are also sending the message that it is okay to share.

So it is actually really powerful concept because when you send information to somebody it is very unlikely that not on every single one you are going to put information or details whether it is okay to share or we will stick on to this.

So what happens is if you actually put this data on the public or on an internal easy to access system then you basically send a message to other players that it is okay to share. So it is okay to send this information to others in a way to send that link to other people and that makes again a massive difference in how that idea that knowledge or that concept actually will propagate across the company and across your environment.
