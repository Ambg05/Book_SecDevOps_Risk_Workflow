### Do security reviews every sprint

If you have an agile development environment, you need to implement security procedures and security reviews at the end of every sprint. In the period between the sprint finishing and going live, you need to do a push to get a sense of whether the original threats and issues, that were highlighted in the threat model, were done, or exist, in a verifiable way.

This task shouldn't be done by the scale, centralized security team. The security champion or contact of each team should do the scale in the one-day-a-week list time that he spends on the application.

If you create a threat model, you can know in advance which apps will need a more indepth security review or analysis, possibly because of the size of the changes, and possibly because of what they are doing, or the assets they are touching. You can then schedule the resources.

You can also plan the level of your involvement from a more central, and a more senior, point of view.
