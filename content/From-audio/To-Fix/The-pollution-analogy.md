### The Pollution Analogy

When talking about risks, I prefer to use the pollution analogy rather than technical debt. The idea of the pollution analogy is that we measure the unintended negative consequences of creating something, which describes pollution exactly.

In the past, pollution was a side effect of the industrial revolution. For a long time, pollution wasn't seen as a problem in the same way that we don't see security vulnerability as a problem today. We still don't understand that views which can discover gaping holes in our infrastructure, and in our code, are a massive problem.

We are still in the infancy of software, and we are in the 1950s in terms of pollution. David Rice gave a great presentation where he talked about this and his concept was exactly this: security is like pollution.

When you find a security vulnerability you interrogate the whole development pipeline and quality control. You question how it is possible that these massive gaps, these massive security vulnerabilities and code patterns weren't picked up, weren't understood by the development teams, by the testers, by QA, by the clients? 

We need to make this pollution visible. I view risk models as a way to measure that pollution, and to measure the difference between team A and team B.

The good news is that security doesn't say no. Security doesn't say "Don't do this, don't do that, or please give me more time to implement this". Security says "If you want to go for feature A in a specific timeline, in a specific scope with a specific brief, then you will have this pollution, or these unintended consequences".  You might have a situation where security says, "Well, if you go in this direction we don't know what the consequences of this change will be".

With this kind of risk, you accept that security adds code that it doesn't understand to the application.

This kind of pollution is good because you can measure it. But ideally we want to create a clean code that doesn't pollute, which is analogous to the evolution of pollution.

The first phase of industrial pollution saw pollution as a necessary side effect of progress. The second phase established the green movement where business had to behave decently, and pollute less. The third phase is most interesting to this analogy because in the third phase companies started to produce things differently to avoid polluting the environment, and to have a positive impact on the environment.

This is where we want to get to in application security. We want to get to the point where we create software that doesn't pollute, but we still have a long way to go.
