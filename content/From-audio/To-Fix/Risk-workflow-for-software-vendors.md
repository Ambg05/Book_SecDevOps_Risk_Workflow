### Risk Workflow for Software Vendors

A software vendor is somebody who delivers a software application that is executed by a client. The same concept will apply to web applications and web apps but let's start with a traditional software package.

So the risk work flow in this case is actually even more important, but there is actually multiple angles, multiple dimensions to take into account. So let's start with a simple one.

The first part is the issues that exists in the software being developed. So here initially there would already the two types of risks. There are the risks that exist on the application that they should know about which should be captured on the risk register and accepted by the business owner, because ultimately they will have to be prioritized and fixed and chosen not to fix depending on priorities.

and then there is a risk that the company is willing to disclose to their customers and this is a mix between legal, governance, business and even marketing because in most companies, security is still a marketing driven exercise because there is no regulation or requirement to actually disclose the truth.

So there is this list which is the list that they expose to customers of the risks that they have. And even this can be broken into clients or important clients that have signed NDA's which basically means they can't disclose it and other issues that can be disclosed publicly because they might fall into the category of risks to be accepted by the product or features that have dangerous implications.

So, if you work on the security team of the software producer, you want to know every risk that exists. So you need to go through the same process, you capture the information, you prioritize it, you understand it, you make your business owners accept the risk that is the flow.

And this also has a lot of interesting and ethical dilemmas because if you have a particular risk that no customer will notice and that is unlikely to be attacked, and there is nobody who will be paying attention to it, do you need to fix it?

And of course you know so the argument is said well you should because it is the right thing to do. But in the real world, business is about making decisions about making risk decisions and a lot of companies would choose not to address those issues.

In fact there is even a perverse reward system where in a lot of companies they get rewarded by not knowing because then they can always claim not to be accountable because they didn't know about a particular problem.

Although I would argue -16/ -17 that is an excuse they can't really use anymore especially if you are having vulnerabilities or problems that are widely know and people have disclosed in all sorts of different places.

So in a situation where you go through it, you find your issues and you really don't want to play the game of security, above security.

Now, if you are a client of those software package, you can be in a tricky situation because if it is a product that is open sourced, at least you have the ability to do a security review and you have the code so at least it is easier, doesn't mean you are going to do it, doesn't mean you have eyeballs looking at it but at least you can do it.

In most traditional products because it is proprietary code you won't be able to have it. So you don't really have a good and optimal and efficient way of looking at the code. And what it means, it means that you are going to be dependent on the information that you get from the vendor which usually isn't very much and you will basically be stuck with having to pay for an independent security review which is actually something I have done in many, many cases.

What is interesting is what happens when you do discover a security problem with the vendor because you are going to report it, in a way you have your own risk register, so you have your own risk register for that particular product where you acknowledge the problems that existed and you discovered in that product.

You report it, now the vendor ideally should already know about it and should have a solution and should have an answer for it. If they don't know about it, it is even worse because that actually represents the fact that they didn't have a risk process, it represents the fact that they weren't paying attention to that problem.

And if you are the vendor and you received those issues disclosed to you, you are now in a very weak position because your client now has a lot more power, has a lot more leverage on you. So in a way you went from being the senior player on the table to the junior player on the table.

An interesting big problem we have as an industry is the fact that when client A discloses this, the vendor doesn't have any legal responsibility to disclose it to client B. Which basically means that they can do a business and a marketing exercise to client A basically keep him happy, give him more licenses, and basically control the limitation because they don't have to tell all the other clients.

The questions the client should be asking are;

a] Do you know about this?
b] How many more of these do you have?
c] Why didn't you tell me in the first place?

That is really what we want, and once we have that, we would have a much better working market, we have a much better model.

So one of the things I do is once you start finding issues on third party components, let's say I am working for the client, and we find issues, one of the things that I will do is also raise a lot of questions on how fit for purpose that particular software is, especially if you start to find really basic vulnerabilities where you know that on the other side, you don't have a security team and they really don't have a good security posture.

So you can see that it is actually quite an interesting multiple dimension problem and in fact I think the risk work flows and the mapping of the risks will be a great currency and will be a great way to measure this.

And actually it is something that if you look at the insurance industry, and the ability to understand the real risk creative applications although one might argue that not all these should be disclosed publicly, at least until it is fixed, it should be argued that they should at least disclose how many they know.

It goes back to this interesting concept that all aspects should play around the past which is the labeling system where you basically create labels for software so we can have like ingredients on a product we have labels of security vulnerabilities that exist there.
