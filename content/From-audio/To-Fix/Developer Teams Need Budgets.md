**Developer Teams Need Budgets**

Business needs to trust developer teams, they need to trust that dev team wants to do the best for that particular project, and that company. And if they don't, then they will have a bigger problem.

And one great way to show that trust is to give that team the power to have a budget, the power to be able to spend money on things that the team believes is best for that team. And this means from perks to devs like going to conferences, buying books, buying things which basically a lot of times a company will get but it is always a struggle, it is always a request, it is always this inertia, it is always this kind of balance of power and there is always this gain that you don't know that sometimes it is easy to ask for fifty pounds than it is to ask for five thousand up to fifty thousand.

So that imbalance is hard to ask for those things. So those imbalances are really hard on teams, or those inconsistencies are really hard on teams.

So what you really want is the teams to be empowered to make those decisions, you need to treat them as adults that they are, you need to trust them, I need to basically say here is a budget I trust you to do the right thing, and my experience in all aspects of organizations shows that it is really hard to spend money.

Because when you spend money especially on that open ended kind of way, you go on a record and it is official, it is either what you do better work out or in a way you start to be accountable.

So it is a very nice kind of double sworded way of keeping the teams honest, and to allow them to focus on what is productive. And this could be something like buying a little bit of tool for the developers, buying stuff that they need, buying a trip, literally operational expenses for the team even hiring a freelancer on one of the freelancing websites just to do some work that can actually be easily outsourced to somebody else.
