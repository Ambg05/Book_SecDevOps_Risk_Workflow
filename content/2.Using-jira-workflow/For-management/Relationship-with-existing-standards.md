What is 'this' and 'them' in this context?

Fact is that more and more external regulatory bodies and laws require some level of proof about the implemented security controls. To prevent unnecessary delays or fines, these requirements should be embedded in the process in the form of regular scans, embedded controls (e.g. in the default infrastrucure), or in user stories.

For example in DevOps environments all requirements related to OS hardening should be present in the default container and not be something that development teams need to think about.
