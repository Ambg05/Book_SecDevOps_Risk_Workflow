### Lack of action is a risk

* lack of time to perform 'root cause analysis' or lack of understanding of what cause the problem is a valid risk in itself

### Feedback loops are key
An error often made is not using the full potential in a company to find the root cause. Incidents get identified by operational monitoring or incident response teams, are send to a security department, and after some analysing are directed to development teams as tickets. The development teams have no knowing of the original incident and cannot put the request in the right perspective. This can lead to sub optimal fixes with undesired side-effects. 

It is beneficial to include development teams in the root cause analysis from the start to make sure the best solution can be identified.
