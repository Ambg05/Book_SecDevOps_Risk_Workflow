### Deliver PenTest reports using JIRA

- much more efficient that creating a PDF
- allows quick validation of findings and direct communication with developers and AppSec team

SUGGESTION:
make some remarks to tools like 'defect dojo' and 'bag of holding' that attempt to act as a triage tool between pentest results and JIRA.
