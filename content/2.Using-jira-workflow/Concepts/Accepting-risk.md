Accepting risk is always a topic of discussion, mostly caused by lack of information.

Risk can, and maybe should, be accepted for a variety of reasons, like for example:
- the system containing the risk will be decommisioned on short term
- the risk can only occur under very specific circumstances, shich would already have caused a bigger risk
- the cost of fixing (both money as resources) is way higher than the cost of fixing operational issues

Risks should never be accepted for issues that can cause:
- threatening the operational existence of the company (e.g. losing a banking license)
- greatly impacting the financial operation of a company (e.g. fines due to data leaks)
- greatly impacting the reputation of a company (e.g. front page news)
